# wayshot
DMA-BUF backend to Wayshot for high-performance screen capture, focusing on the benefits, implementation considerations, and how it would integrate with OBS and a custom desktop portal.

**Core Problem:**

Wayshot's current CPU-based image capture and transformation pipeline is a bottleneck, especially when dealing with high resolutions, frame rates, and complex transformations.  This limits its performance and suitability for demanding applications like live streaming and recording.

**Proposed Solution: DMA-BUF Backend**

The core idea is to leverage DMA-BUF (Direct Memory Access Buffer) to enable GPU-accelerated screen capture and processing.  Here's a breakdown of what that entails:

*   **DMA-BUF Overview:** DMA-BUF is a Linux kernel mechanism that allows different devices (e.g., GPU, display controller, camera) to share memory buffers directly without unnecessary copies through the CPU.  This is crucial for performance because it avoids the overhead of copying large image data between system memory and GPU memory.

*   **DMA-BUF Backend in Wayshot:**  This means creating a new backend within Wayshot that utilizes DMA-BUF to:
    *   **Capture Screen Content:** Instead of the CPU reading pixels from the screen buffer, the GPU (or a dedicated display controller) would directly write the screen content into a DMA-BUF.
    *   **Perform Transformations:**  Image transformations (scaling, cropping, color adjustments, etc.) would be offloaded to the GPU using shaders or other GPU-accelerated techniques.  The GPU would read from the DMA-BUF containing the captured screen content, perform the transformations, and write the result to another DMA-BUF.
    *   **Provide Access to Transformed Data:**  The final transformed image data would reside in a DMA-BUF, ready for consumption by other applications.

*   **Client-Side API:**  A new client-side API would be provided to allow applications to interact with the DMA-BUF backend.  This API would likely include functions for:
    *   **Requesting a Capture:**  Specifying the region of the screen to capture, the desired frame rate, and any transformations to apply.
    *   **Accessing the DMA-BUF:**  Obtaining a file descriptor (fd) representing the DMA-BUF containing the captured and transformed image data.
    *   **Synchronization:**  Mechanisms to ensure that the DMA-BUF contains valid data (e.g., waiting for a frame to be captured and transformed).
    *   **Releasing Resources:**  Properly releasing the DMA-BUF and associated resources when the application is finished.

**Integration with OBS and Custom Desktop Portal**

This is where the real power of the DMA-BUF backend comes into play:

*   **Custom Desktop Portal Backend:**  Wayshot likely uses a desktop portal (like XDG Desktop Portal) to request screen capture permissions from the user and to access the screen content.  The "custom desktop portal backend" would be modified to:
    *   **Negotiate DMA-BUF Sharing:**  When an application requests screen capture, the portal would negotiate with the compositor (the window manager) to obtain a DMA-BUF representing the screen content.
    *   **Pass the DMA-BUF to Wayshot:**  The portal would pass the DMA-BUF file descriptor to Wayshot's DMA-BUF backend.
    *   **Handle Security:**  The portal would enforce security policies to ensure that applications only have access to the screen content they are authorized to capture.

*   **OBS Integration:**  OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) would be modified to:
    *   **Use the Wayshot Client-Side API:**  OBS would use the new Wayshot API to request screen capture and obtain the DMA-BUF file descriptor.
    *   **Import the DMA-BUF:**  OBS would use the DMA-BUF file descriptor to import the DMA-BUF into its own rendering pipeline.  This allows OBS to directly access the captured and transformed screen content without any CPU copies.
    *   **Encode and Stream:**  OBS would then encode the image data from the DMA-BUF and stream it to the desired platform (e.g., Twitch, YouTube).

**Benefits:**

*   **High Performance:**  Eliminating CPU copies significantly reduces latency and CPU usage, allowing for higher frame rates and resolutions.
*   **GPU Acceleration:**  Offloading image transformations to the GPU frees up the CPU for other tasks and enables more complex and visually appealing effects.
*   **Reduced Latency:**  Direct DMA-BUF sharing minimizes the delay between capturing the screen and displaying it in OBS.
*   **Improved Scalability:**  The GPU-accelerated pipeline can handle more concurrent streams and higher resolutions without performance degradation.
*   **Lower Power Consumption:**  Reducing CPU usage can lead to lower power consumption, which is especially important for laptops and mobile devices.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Compositor Support:**  The compositor (e.g., Mutter, KWin, Sway) must support DMA-BUF sharing for screen capture.  This is becoming increasingly common, but it's important to verify compatibility.
*   **GPU Driver Support:**  The GPU driver must support DMA-BUF import and export.
*   **Security:**  Careful attention must be paid to security to prevent applications from accessing screen content they are not authorized to capture.  The desktop portal plays a crucial role in enforcing these security policies.
*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is essential to deal with situations where DMA-BUF sharing fails or the GPU encounters errors.
*   **API Design:**  The client-side API should be easy to use and well-documented.
*   **Synchronization:**  Proper synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure that the DMA-BUF contains valid data and to avoid race conditions.
*   **Format Negotiation:**  The API needs to handle different pixel formats and color spaces.  Negotiation between Wayshot and the client (e.g., OBS) is important.
*   **Memory Management:**  Properly managing the DMA-BUF memory is crucial to avoid memory leaks.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  User starts OBS and selects "Wayshot Screen Capture" as a source.
2.  OBS uses the Wayshot client-side API to request screen capture from the custom desktop portal.
3.  The desktop portal prompts the user for permission to share the screen.
4.  If the user grants permission, the portal negotiates a DMA-BUF with the compositor.
5.  The portal passes the DMA-BUF file descriptor to Wayshot.
6.  Wayshot configures the GPU to capture the screen content into the DMA-BUF and apply any requested transformations.
7.  OBS imports the DMA-BUF into its rendering pipeline.
8.  OBS encodes the image data from the DMA-BUF and streams it to the desired platform.


**In a nutshell, the DMA-BUF backend for Wayshot aims to significantly improve screen capture performance by leveraging the GPU for capturing and transforming screen content, avoiding slow CPU-based operations.**

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Purpose:**

*   **High-Performance Screen Capture:** To provide a faster and more efficient way to capture screen content compared to the existing CPU-based approach.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** To offload image processing tasks (like scaling, cropping, and color adjustments) from the CPU to the GPU.
*   **Enable High-Quality Streaming and Recording:** To make Wayshot suitable for demanding applications like live streaming (e.g., with OBS) and high-resolution screen recording.

**2. Functionality:**

*   **DMA-BUF Capture:**
    *   Uses the DMA-BUF (Direct Memory Access Buffer) mechanism in the Linux kernel to allow the GPU (or a dedicated display controller) to directly capture screen content into a shared memory buffer.  This avoids copying the screen data through the CPU.
*   **GPU Transformation:**
    *   Performs image transformations (scaling, cropping, color adjustments, etc.) on the captured data using GPU shaders or other GPU-accelerated techniques.  The GPU reads the captured data from the DMA-BUF, applies the transformations, and writes the result to another DMA-BUF.
*   **Client-Side API:**
    *   Provides a programming interface (API) for applications (like OBS) to:
        *   Request screen capture with specific parameters (region, frame rate, transformations).
        *   Obtain a file descriptor (fd) representing the DMA-BUF containing the captured and transformed image data.
        *   Synchronize with the capture process to ensure data is ready.
        *   Release the DMA-BUF and associated resources.
*   **Custom Desktop Portal Integration:**
    *   Works with a custom desktop portal backend to:
        *   Request screen capture permissions from the user.
        *   Negotiate DMA-BUF sharing with the compositor (window manager).
        *   Pass the DMA-BUF file descriptor to Wayshot.
        *   Enforce security policies to ensure applications only access authorized screen content.

**3. Benefits:**
